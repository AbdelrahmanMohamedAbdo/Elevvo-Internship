# 🌐 **Elevvo Data Analytics Internship**

## 🧭 **Overview**
This repository documents the work completed during the virtual *Data Analytics Internship*.  
I have completed all *5 foundational tasks*, demonstrating core competencies in *SQL-based business intelligence*, *customer segmentation*, and *data preparation techniques*.

---

## 📊 **Task 1: Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel)**
- Analyzed sales data and applied *advanced formatting for clarity*.  
- Generated summarized metrics using *Pivot Tables*, including:
  - *Total Revenue*
  - *Units Sold*
  - *Monthly Trend Analysis*
- Built a *dynamic reporting interface* with charts and *Slicers* for interactive filtering by region.  
- Calculated *Year-over-Year (YoY)* and *Month-over-Month (MoM)* performance changes.

---

## 🚢 **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset**
- Cleaned and prepared the raw dataset by handling *missing values* and adjusting *data types*.  
- Conducted *statistical analysis* to reveal survival rates based on:
  - *Gender*
  - *Passenger Class*
- Used *Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)* to create *bar plots* and *heatmaps*, visualizing key survival patterns and correlations.

## 🎯 **Task 3: Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis**
- Developed and executed a *multi-step RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)* segmentation model using *SQL*.  
- Calculated customer metrics:
  - *Recency* – days since last purchase  
  - *Frequency* – number of transactions  
  - *Monetary* – total spending  
- Used the *NTILE()* window function to assign R, F, and M scores, generating combined *RFM Scores* (e.g., `555` for Champions).  
- Identified *high-value customer segments* for *targeted marketing strategies*.

## 🧹 **Task 4: Data Cleaning and Insight Generation (Survey Data)**
- Performed *deep cleaning* on complex survey data, including text standardization and handling inconsistent entries.  
- Applied *label encoding* and *data mapping* to prepare categorical responses for quantitative analysis.  
- Extracted and summarized the *Top 5 Actionable Insights* regarding respondent behavior and preferences.  
- Designed a *summary dashboard* highlighting key behavioral trends.

---

## 🗄️ **Task 5: SQL-Based Analysis of Product Sales (Chinook Database)**
- Executed *advanced SQL queries* with multiple *JOINs* to connect transactional, product, and customer data.  
- Delivered insights on:
  - *Top-selling products* (by revenue and quantity)  
  - *Geographic Sales Analysis* (by country and city)  
  - *Monthly Revenue Performance*
- Applied the *RANK()* window function to segment and identify *top-performing products* in each market.
